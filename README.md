### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [some secret stuff](https://github.com/Sage-Active/service-teams-copilot-bff)

I used to work on:
- [the new Std PE](https://github.com/Sage/sage200uki-std-pe) current build status: [![.NET](https://github.com/Sage/sage200uki-std-pe/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Sage/sage200uki-std-pe/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

- Also [the new Std Background Worker](https://github.com/Sage/sage200uki-std-bw)
- The [Sage 200 Std Dependencies Repo](https://github.com/Sage/Sage200StdUKI)
